route 53 policies- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html
route 53- domain registration, health checks and monitoring

ec2- IaaS

security groups- instance level, allow rules only, default is no rules so nothing allowed, stateful so a response from a request sent out is allowed, and responses are allowed out if the request was allowed in

nacl- subnet level, has both deny and allow rules, default is it allows everything in and out, has list of rules evaluated in order

account removal from Organizations- only if it can stand alone

service plans- memorize more stuff like which ones give access to infrastructre event management

EBS- one availability zone, one instance

EFS- multiple instances multiple availability zones

data transfer charges- generally none for in, none for between services in same region, some for outbound

WAF protects these services- cloudfront, api gatweway, load balancer, graphql api, cognito
waf cost- not free
waf protection layer- 7 (application)
waf- protects against sql injection, cross site scripting

EC2 reserved costs- 3 year cheaper than 1 year for all payment option combos

Reservable services- ec2, dynamodb, rds, elasticache, redshift

Dedicated host- dedicated server, can bring own licences, no shared hardware
Dedicated instance- dedicated instance, no licenses, no hardware shared across accounts, but shared within account

AWS abuse team- reportabuse of service, like spam

min 1 datacenter per az, 2 az per region

aurora patching- automatic by aws

transcribe- speech to text, translate- translate text, polly- text to speech

AWS Shield Advanced ddos protection- EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Route 53, AWS Global Accelerator

encryption enabled by default- cloudtrail, aws storage gateway, glacier

x-ray- debugging for serverless apps

aws partner network consulting partners- consulting for migrating/architecting/managing
aws partner network technology partners- provide hardware, software, connectivity services

aws systems manager- sits on top of cloudwatch, cloudtrail, trusted advisor etc, showing you all of that info, and also allows for some automation of tasks

cloudhsm- managed service, hardware security module, deals with creating and managing keys

local zones- use compute close to user
edge locations- cache data close to user

elastic beanstalk- for deploying web apps, can still access underlying os

emr- big data, can provision resources to do things like hadoop
batch- provision resources to run batch computing
step functions- cant provison resources, just orchestrates

mq- message broker services

config- tracks configuration changes to resources, cloudtrail does not

auto-scaling- enables auto scaling (out) on various services

subnet- one availabilty zone
vpc- all availability zones in a region

storage gateway- hybrid cloud storage, has tape (backups), file (stored in s3), and volume (ebs) types

guard duty- monitors accounts for weird activity

athena- query across s3 using sql

business plan- cheapest for enhanced tech support
enterprise plan- concierge support team, critical < 15, tam

prevent ddos- shield, waf, cloudfront with route 53

rds customer responsibility- db encryption, no patching

compute optimizer analyzes- ebs, lambda, ec2, ec2 auto scaling

user blocking- waf, route 53, acl

kendra- nlp processing of unstructured data for search, finding specific documents, managed
comprehend- also nlp processing of unstructured data, for insights

default high availability storage/db- dynamodb, efs

cloudwatch- access logs from multiple areas, e.g. on premises and in cloud
cloudwatch billing is stored in N virginia us east 1
cloudwatch monitoring- api access, resource utilization

efs files can be accessed by ec2 instances regardless of what zone, region, or vpc the instance is in

ami must be in same region as ec2

cost allocation tags in aws billing- keuy must be unique and have only one value, aws and user tags must be activated for them to appear in report

block level storage- ebs, instance store

iam policy must contain- action (list of actions allowed or denied), effect (i.e. allow or deny)

pay to read- efs infrequent access, s3 infrequent access and glacier

online analytical processing- redshift

aws budget types- cost, usage, reservation, savings plans

read replica use case- performance/scalability bc read queries wont interfere with other stuff

customer gateway- on premises door
vpc private gateway- door to the vpc
vpc endpoint gateway- connect vpc directly to services (s3 and dynamodb)
vpc interface endpoint- connect to other services
direct connect- connect on premises servers to aws
transit gateway- connect multiple vpcs and on prem networks 
vpc peering- connect two vpcs
internet gateway- connect intances within vpc to internet
storage gateway- connect on prem servers to cloud storage
api gateway- not part of a vpc, managed service for creating and maintaing apis
network address translation gateway/instance- allows instances in private subnet to connect to internet, but internet cant connect, gateway is managed, instance is not

credential reports- shows all users, passwords, keys

s3 transfer acceleration- fast file transfer to s3, uses edge locations
s3 stores data in a flat heirarcy, is key value based
s3 allows life cycle management rules to move stuff around based on the rules

device farm- testing across different devices/browsers

service that allows billing alarms- cloudwatch
service that allows notifications for under or overutilization- budgets

read replicas can be in different regions

fargate- serverless compute for containers

hardware mfa- device that generates numbers for you
u2f- usb authentication

aws org cost savings thing- different accounts have to be using instances in the same az

storage that can be used on prem- efs

ec2 instance user data- bootstrap script that runs on ec2 startup

application load balancer- balance http(s) traffic
network load balancer- balance tcp, udp, and tls traffic

cognito- user signin/signup

cost explorer- monitor costs, savings plans
budgets- set custom budgets, get alerts when you exceed or are forecasted to exceed budget

code guru- automate code review

shared responsibility for aws and customer- config management, os config

temporary creds- aws security token service

total cost of ownership is what you currently pay to maintain your stuff, pre cloud migration
